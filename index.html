  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <h3>Journey into Tech:</h3>
  <p>I embarked on a transformative journey into the tech industry driven by my passion for leveraging technology to make a positive impact on people's lives. With a strong desire to use my skills and knowledge to make other people's jobs easier and more productive, I chose to pursue a career as a software engineer. I firmly believe that software engineers are crucial team members for any organization, as they combine technical expertise with strong interpersonal skills to solve complex problems and drive innovation.</p>

  <h3>Skills:</h3>
  <p>Throughout my journey, I have acquired a diverse set of technical skills that empower me to tackle various challenges. My expertise includes HTML, C programming, Python, and JavaScript. I have honed my skills in these languages through practical projects and continuous learning. In addition to technical proficiency, I also possess strong problem-solving abilities, attention to detail, and effective communication skills. These attributes enable me to approach complex problems with confidence and collaborate effectively with cross-functional teams.</p>

  <h3>Hobbies outside coding:</h3>
  <p>While I am passionate about technology, I also find balance and inspiration in activities beyond coding. One of my favorite hobbies is playing football, where I not only stay physically active but also cultivate teamwork, discipline, and perseverance. Football has taught me valuable lessons about collaboration, strategy, and maintaining a competitive spirit. Furthermore, I have a deep appreciation for exploring the world through travel. Traveling allows me to immerse myself in diverse cultures, broaden my horizons, and gain fresh perspectives. It fuels my curiosity, enhances my adaptability, and fosters personal growth.</p>
